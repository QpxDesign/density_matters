## density_matters - design cites for people

### What this is

This is a web app, and its purpose is to educate people about how cities should be designed in a way that favors the enviroment and people. It is meant to encoruage people to perfer denser housing projects and to support them poltically. It does this through calculators, maps, and interactive data explorers. Its endgoal is to transform suburbs into walkable, public transit friendly, and enviromently conscious dense communites. I am currently developing this for my Environmental Science Class.
